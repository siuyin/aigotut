4,Why the sky is blue,"The sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering. For light frequencies well below the resonance frequency of the scattering medium (normal dispersion regime), the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, e.g., a blue color is scattered much more than a red color as light propagates through air."
5,Why are leaves green,Leaves are green because chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light. Most leaves come in various shades of green. This is due to pigments called chlorophyll. The name comes from the Greek words chloros (green) and phyllon (leaf). There are six types of chlorophyll in nature. The two main types in plants are chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. Chlorophyll a absorbs violet and orange light the most. Chlorophyll b absorbs mostly blue and yellow light.
